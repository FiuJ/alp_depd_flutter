## Quick setup notes

- Package name set to `alp_depd_flutter` (merged to match `origin/main`).
- This project uses `image_picker` and optional Supabase/provider packages. Run `flutter pub get` after pulling.
- If you plan to use environment variables, add a `.env` file at the project root.

Run these once locally:

```powershell
flutter pub get
```

To add `image_picker` (if needed):

```powershell
flutter pub add image_picker
```
